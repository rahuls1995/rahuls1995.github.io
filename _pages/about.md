I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Chicago's [Institute for Climate and Sustainable Growth](https://climate.uchicago.edu) and the [Climate Systems Engineering Initiative (CSEi)](https://climateengineering.uchicago.edu), 
working with [Dr. Peter Irvine](https://pjirvine.github.io//). My current research focuses on assessing the efficacy of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) in mitigating the impacts of 
global warming. During my Ph.D. studies under the guidance of [Prof. Sandeep Sukumaran](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~san81/), I investigated the dynamic interaction between dry air advection and 
the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). I developed a Dry Air Intrusion (DAI) index to analyze the influence of dry air advection on the ISM, incorporating parameters 
such as moisture deficit and zonal wind. Through the analysis of observational data and climate model simulations, including CMIP6 experiments and CESM1.2.2 model 
sensitivity simulations, I have gained valuable insights into the impact of dry air intrusion on precipitation patterns across continental India.
